# PokemonGOAPI
An API made using .NET Core 3.0 for gathering and providing information about Pokemon GO.

## Take note
- This API is calling another PokemonGO API that provides the data, but with the advantage of having some filters to most of the 
routes and dealing with it pretty fast. The link for the actual PokemonGO API can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/brianiswu/api/pokemon-go1) so you can consume the data as well (giving credit where it's due). 

- To consume the above mentioned data, you must have a RapidAPI account. It's free and easy to create one, just do it and go the link I posted above.
