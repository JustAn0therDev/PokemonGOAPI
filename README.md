# PokemonGOAPI
An API made using .NET Core 3 for gathering and providing information about Pokemon GO.

## Take note
This is a work-in-progress API and I'll be making changes and adding features to it as time goes by. 
As it goes with my other projects, if you'd like, feel free to fork this project and make a pull request if it tickles your fancy.
